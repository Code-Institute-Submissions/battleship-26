# **_Battleships_**

Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.

## Game Structure

In battleships I wanted to structure the game where we look at the grid and make is visiable to see the row
and column of the game. It is a 2D array and I used - as a miss and X as a hit to indicate whether the ship has been hit or not.

## Design Choices
    The design choice was to go for an 8x8 grid which is a good size for all the ships to be able to place on the board and I used lines to create the board and used a seperator on the top to give distance with the Letters and the board

* ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme I chose is basic white for this game.

## Future Features 

* A better colour scheme to make it look more pretty and to make it a better eye catcher for when people are playing it.
   
* To improve the AI so it is more intelligent.
    * The computer can be more clever when picking ships
* Improve the design so by adding more layouts instead of just using a basic 2d version.
